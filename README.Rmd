# flexCountReg

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of flexCountReg is to provide functions that allow the analyst to estimate count regression models that can handle multiple analysis issues including excess zeros, overdispersion as a function of variables (i.e., generalized count models), random parameters, etc.

## Installation

You can install the development version of flexCountReg like using:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jwood-iastate/flexCountReg")
```

## Example

The following is an example of using flexCountReg to estimate a negative binomial regression model with the overdispersion parameter as a function of predictor variables:

```{r example}
library(flexCountReg)

data("washington_roads")
washington_roads$AADTover10k <- ifelse(washington_roads$AADT>10000,1,0)
gen.nb2 <- flexCountReg(Total_crashes ~ lnaadt + lnlength + speed50 +
                                ShouldWidth04 + AADTover10k,
                                ln.alpha.formula = ~ 1+lnlength,
                                data=washington_roads,
                                dist="NB2",
                                method = 'NM')
summary(gen.nb2)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
